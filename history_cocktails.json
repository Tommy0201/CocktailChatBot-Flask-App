Soft, sweet, and delicately fruity, the Clover Club endures as a symbol of America’s bygone club era and early literary salons."

As per Don’s flair for showmanship, he kept the recipe guarded to amp up its mystique but it clearly contains multiple rums and tropical flavors. Potent and strong enough to make patrons feel like “zombies” after a few, it became iconic, inspiring the blender loaded with rum that became synonymous with Tiki bars."

The tonic was supercharged with quinine, and it was much more potent than what\u2019s used today. Initially, the Brits cut the flavor with sweet spirits, such as rum. Gin was incorporated as early as 1868, when a magazine reported spectators at a horse-racing event in India were asking for the refreshing drink."
